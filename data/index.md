# Welcome to Nuggetz CMS

## This website was built with Nuggetz

Unlike the old version on Nuggetz, this is a static website.
This is a `markdown` nugget, but there are others.

Nuggetz is in development. This website will dog-food the CMS. 

So expect, bugs errors and downtime as we go!

You can follow on Twitter [@nuggetzcms](https://twitter.com/nuggetzcms).

The repo for this site is [here](https://github.com/olliephillips/nuggetz-cms) (for the time being)

Nuggetz CMS repo will be public soon

This site is hosted on Cloudflare pages. It could be a AWS, GCP or other cloudfiles bucket.
It could be hosted just about anywhere. Simply, and affordably.

### Hope you can join us for the ride!

## Why deploy a "static" website?

#### Fast
Pages can be rendered without needing to be assembled first, which generally requires round trips to databases

#### Security
Hosting is generally simpler, with no application or database, meaning a smaller attack surface

#### Simplicity
Fewer updates needed, fewer things to go wrong

#### Low cost
The cost of hosting HTML and assets very low compared to the resources needed to run an application and web server

#### Version control
The entire website and its assets can be managed in version control, and can use automation for builds
